to Zeus, and so sister to the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux),
who sprang from the other egg. She was the most beauti-
ful woman of her day, and Paris carried her off by aid of
Aphrodite. Menelaus instantly levied war against Troy.
AH the Greeks (Danai, Argolici, Graii, Achivi, Pelasgi)
lent him their aid, and his brother Agamemnon, king of
Mycenae, took upon himself the supreme command. On the
voyage out the fleet was becalmed at Aulis in Euboea, where
Artemis (Diana) kept it wind-bound in anger for a sacrilege
done to her by Agamemnon, nor could he propitiate the
goddess save by the sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia.
Upon reaching the Troad, or country of Troy, the war
dragged on with varying issues for ten years. At the end
of that time, Agamemnon carried off Chryseis, daughter of
a priest of Apollo at Lyrnessus. For this Apollo sent a
plague upon the host, and the king was forced to surrender
his prize. In compensation he seized Briseis, who was the
captive of Achilles, the bravest of the Greeks. The latter
refused to fight against the foe, until Patroclus, his dearest
comrade, was slain by Hector. Roused by this to fight again,
he met and slew Hector, but was himself slain soon after by
Paris. The Greeks now resorted to stratagem. They con-
structed a gigantic horse of wood, shut up within it their
picked warrior-S, and sailed away to Tenedos. They left,
however, one of their number, Sinon, to pretend enmity to
them, and so to induce the Trojans to drag the horse up to
their citadel as a sure way of securing the favour of heaven.
They did so, the warriors came out in the night time, opened
the gates to their fellows, who had sailed back in the dark-
ness, and in this way Troy was captured. The town was
destroyed utterly, and the fugitives fied whither they could.
Amongst them was Aeneas, son of Anchises and Aphrodite,
who sailed away wit-h twenty ships to found a new city.
