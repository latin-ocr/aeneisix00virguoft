viii INTRODUCTION.

Greece was probably undertaken for the sake of his health,
and the same reasons may have prompted his choice of
a residence near Naples; near which town he was buried,
with the following epitaph inscribed above him :—

⁵⁶ Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
Parthenope ε cecini pascua, rura, duces. ”

ξ 2. The earliest works of Vergil were possibly some or
311 of the minor pieces known as the Culex (θηαί), Ciris,
Moretum (δἀῖαῑί), C'opa (Hostess); but the
authenticity of all these is open to question.
His fame as a poet began with the publication, prior to
B.C. 35, of the Ecloycce or Bucolica, ten brief poems,
imit-ating the pastoral poetry of Theocritus the Syracusan
(3rd cent. Rc.) Like all the great works of Vergil, these
are written in hexameters, and it was the smoothness of
the versification and the novelty of the subject which gained
them their popularity. Vergil loved the country, and
Maecenas made use of his taste to persuade him to write
3 long didactic poem on Agriculture—the Georyz'cs—which
describes in four books the management of crOPS‚ of trees
and vines, of cattle and horses, and of 11999. Didactic
poetry is such as conx‘e3⁷s systematic instruction in the
form of verse 3 and while the Georyics are so poetica] as to
rank for beauty as highly perhaps as any Latin poetry,
they were considered valuable guides to the pursuits of
which they treated. Maecenas persuaded the poet to
undertake this task in order to please Augustus, who was
endeavouring to restore the old industry, virtues, and
rural life of Italy, and required a fit poet to glorify
husbandry. Vergil's model here was Hesiod of Ascra
(Sth cent. Bc), but he also made use of many poets of the
Alexandrine School of the third and second centuries B.c.
The work was published Β.0. 29.

But the fame of Vergil rests upon his crowning work, the
Aeneisl, an epic of nearly ten thousand lines. It was
long before he could be prevailed upon to undertake the
poem, and when he died he had already been engaged upon
it for ten years. Augustus had wished a poem to immor—
talise his own great victories ε Vergil chose a subject which
