sores. 35

268, dicere sortem: ⁴⁴ appoint the partition of the spoil.” Praecla&
is dative of reference (Con.)

269. The mood of ibat shows that the clauses are merely attribu-
tive——“ the horse and arms wherewith T. rode.’' If they were inter-
rogative we should have iret, “with what horse and arms he rode ’'
(S. G. ξ 433). The antecedents equom, arma, are unexpressed, but
equo, armis are inserted in the relative clause by way of compensa-
tion. Aureus is transferred from the ablatives to the nominative by
h-ypallaqe. Cp. v. 104, n.

271. sorti : (i) dative, ef. S. G. ξ 292, obs. 2 ; (11) archaic ablative.
The termination -ἰῗ for original -zd marks the abl. of -i stems, eg.
ovi, «iqui, tussi, orbi, 3ἰὶιῖ ,· but it was extended by analogy to others,
e.g. laci, lapidi.

273. omnibus: dative, equivalent to the genitive omnium. Cp.
‹sa-0 sibi gyladia Itane inquam

274. insuper: used like sapor as a preposition with the ablative
(“ besides ”). campi : S. G. ξ 270.

275. te: Euryalus.

280. fides : sc. erit. Ithere means ‘⁴ confidence in‚’' “ reliance upon.”

282. arguerit: fut. perf.. expressing what will certainly happen.

283. †There is a v. 1., aut adversa, in which case the translation
must be, ‘⁶ thus much Ι aver, let fortune be kind or hostile.”

284. vetusta: “ old in time; time honoured‚’' like antiquas.
Pm'seas, belonging to olden time, old-fashjoned. Vetas, aged.

286. Acestae: cp. 218, η.

287. The order is linquo hane {quaram Izaz'as pericli, quodcum-
que est, insalutatamque. inque salutatam : by tmesis (enttiuq)
for insalutatam, which would not· scan in a hexameter line. It is
especially common with the syllable in, whether z not (as here) or
as the preposition cp. X 794, inutilis· inque liquam,- and also with
the prepositions super, eir eam.

289. nequeam: the subjunctive may be explained (i) as in oblique
narration depending on ΐεςΐὶ3-“ my witness that (I do it) because
Ι cannot. . . . ; (ii) potential—‘ I should be unable, it I made the
effort, . . .'' in which case ηοω . . . demera· is parenthetical.

291. tui: “hope in yon.'' Objective genitive. Notice the hiatus
(i.e.‚ non-elision) in taz aziclentior. It may here be due to the length
of the pause (colon), but cannot always be so explained3 cp. IV. 235,
where it is a conscious imitation of Homer ; cp. also v. 647 u..

296. sponde: “ pledge;’' that is, “assure thyself of.'’ † There is

⁷ another reading, spondeo.

298. defuerit: like arquerit, v, 282, n. partum: “ birth,'' ἵζε.. the
one who bore such a son. Mazaeo, with accus. = to await, be in
store for3 with dative = be reserved or destined for. Cp. V. 302.

305. Gnosius: a native of Gnosus or Gnossus (also spelt with an
initial O), a Dorian colony on the N. coast of Crete, the sabled
capital of Minos. Hence Gnosius = Cretan. habilem: “had fitted
for wear‚” liat. ‘⁵ so as to be handy ε ” this use of an adjective to express
the result is called Prolepsis. Cp. oblita labor-mn. v. 225.
