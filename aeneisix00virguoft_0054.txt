30 AENEID IX.

perfect or present, the former if the command has a definite subject,
the latter if the subject is indefinite.

115. The order is Turno dabitur maria eoeurere antequam clabitur
sas-rag pinu-s· eam-ere. Dare = “to allow ” is common. It is here
impersonal.

117. deae pelagi : predicative—“ go and be goddesses of ocean,'' i.e.‚
Nereide. Quaeque is singular. It is rarely found in the plural, but
is usually constructed as here in quasi-apposition with a plural noun.

119. modo: cp. note on v, 706.

122. pontoque feruntur : “float over the sea.’' For the ablative
without a preposition, cp. v. 21. It is especially common in the
sense of ⁴· over.'' ·

123. animis ς ablative of the part concerned.

125. rauca: adverbial accusative, S. G. ξ 253. Cp. torva tuens,
‘·' scowling fiercely,'' and the English ‘⁵ to look daggers.”

127. 111110 : see on V. 7, n. Here it expresses Turnus' uneoepeeted
courage.

131. rerum pars altera : ‘³ one half of their world.'’ The Trojans,
he says, had staked half their safety upon the vessels in which they
could make their escape like cowards.

132. gentes : added in apposition to milia, which is a substantive,
whereas mille. is an adjective. Occasionally mille is found as a
substantive, but milia is ne ver an adjective.

133. 1111 ; S. G. ξ 253.

134. si qua : acc. neut. plur. of .ςί quis· (adj), agreeing with responsa,
Turnus in his excitement using ros . . . quis for the more gram-
matical *cestrum . . . quis.

135. Veneri: mother of Aeneas, and so the guardian deity of the
Trojans and their descendants, the Romans. quod: ‘⁶ 111 that they
have touched.'' It is really an accusative of limitation: e.g. qnod
ser-ibis, flandra, ·‘ as to your writing, 1 am glad.” Hence the ordinary
use = ‘⁶ because.’'

138. praerepta: the ablative absolute is here causal, “since my
bride has been snatched from me.''

139. solisque : neque would be more usual after the preceding nee,
which here negatives both tanqe't and lic-et. Turnus argues that he
has as much right as Agamemnon to 'take up arms for the recovery
of a stolen bride. Mycenae was the home of Agamemnon. See
IndeX‚ s. τ. Τ1013. ·

140. sed periisse: “‘but it is enough,' say ye, ‘that they have
been once ruined.⁷ Then it ought to have been enough to have
sinned (once) before, Ι say, loathing well-nigh all womankind utterly
(as they surely must).” The misconduct of Helen ruined Troy, and
should have taught them to let alone the brides of other men3 yet
they were now attempting to do to Turnus what Paris did to
Menelaus. sed: introduces the objection supposed to be made by
one pleading for the Trojans. The more usual formula in such a
case is at enim. fuisset: (i) jussive subjunctive, implying necessity.
It is most usual in the present tense, e.g. terme· 7103 praescribunt quos
