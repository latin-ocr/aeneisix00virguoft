520. certant: verbs of striving as a rule express the object by ut
and subjunctive. Caum· and certo are exceptions, but the latter verb
is so used by poets only.

522. pinum: here a “torch of pine-wood ’² (ta-eda). Etruscam:
because Mezentius was tyrant of Caere. See IndeX.

523. equom: gen. plural, like divom, v. 6. So virum, v. 527.

525. Calliope: see Index, sar. Musae. Canenti (sc. mihi) goverus
the following perfects subjunctive of indirect question. S. G. ξ 433.

527. virum : partitive genitive plural, depending on quem. Orco:
prose writing would require ad oren-m, inasmuch as motion cannot
properly be expressed by the dative. The phrase, however, is a
direct translation of a similar Homeric use of the dative, which may
account forits retention by Vergil (Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν), He makes free
use of this extended dative, eg. it elamor caela, facilis desa-emus
Averno, ponto iaciunt (v. 712). It is really an extension of the
dative ot advantage, ‘⁶ for Orcus to receive,’'' and the idea of motion
is not inherent in it. For the whole line cp. v. 785, iuvenum primos
tot mis-erit Oreo ,Ρ

528. oras belli: “unfold the thread of the war.” Another trans-
lation of a. Homeric phrase (πεῖραρ πολέμοιο). Ora signifies the
end or edge of anythjng‚ whence it is used for the margin of land,
the shore. From meaning the extremity‚ eff. of a rope, it came to
mean the rope itself ; whence the metaphor in evolvere, to unroll.

530. vasto suspectu : “os vast height.” Suspectus is literally “a
gazing upward‚” and so the distance of gaze, the height. Vastus,
identical with our word “ waste,” most commonly means “desolate ; ”

531. loco: ablative of respect—‘¹' convenient in position.⁷'

534. intorquere z >not ‘⁶ hurl in ’³ but “ at ⁷⁷ (the foe).

535. princeps : adjective, secondary predicate. lampada : S. G„ ξ 40.

536. plurima vento : ‘⁵ (made) mighty by the wind.'' Conington
objects to this, and takes plurima as secondary predicate with 007·-
‘rz'puit ; rento as ablative of cause—‘⁴ seized upon the stories in
volumes, by reason of the breeze.”

538. trepidare . . ,ve11e: cp. v. 509, η.

540. pondere: causa] ablative with prosubviz‘. It was the weight
of the Trojans crowdjng to one side which caused the tower’s fall.
Subito is probably an adverb.

543. pectora. : for the accus. see note on v. 582.

546. regi: dative of advantage. Maeonia (Lydia) lay south of
Troy on the seaboard of Asia Minor.

547. sustulerat z “had reared.” An unusual use as applied to the
mother. Of the father, tollo signifies to “ acknowledge ’⁹ an infant by

sc. a patre.

552. haud nescia: “though full well aware.3’ The use of two
