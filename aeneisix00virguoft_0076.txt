Latium, -ii, n. : the country of the Latini, lying on the west coast
of Italy, between the Tiber and the Sabines on the north, the Marsi

In the time of the kings this region was divided amongst several
small tribes, such as the Aequi, Hernici, Volsci, and the Prisci Latini,
Aborigines, or Old Latins, named after the mythical King Latinus
of Laurentum (see Introd., ξ 4.) The latter then occupied thirty cities
in the immediate neighbourhood of Rome, chief amongst which was
Alba Longa. After Alba was rased by Tullus Hostilius, the Latini
were gradually reduced by successive kingS, until the expulsion of
Tarquin the Arrogant gave them the opportunity of throwing off the
yoke of Rome. They were finally conquered at the close of the Latin
War, 338 B.C., and many of their towns received the full eit-itas, or
franchise, of Rome. The remainder became allied towns (socii), with
certain special privileges, and were known as the IVomeu Latinum, in
