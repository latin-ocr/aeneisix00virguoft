NOTES. 37

345. The adjectives in this line are all predicative.

346. cratera: cp. v. 24, ἠ.. tegebat : the imperfect expresses here thc
attempt, as often—“was trying to hide himself.'’ Cf. S. G. ξ 396.

348. condidit: the subject is again Euryalus Cui is the dative of
reference equivalent to the (possessive) genitive euius. multa morte :
“he drew back his swerd with streams of death.'’ Le.. spuiting
streams of his opponent's life-blood. The ablative is one of attendant
circumstance, and the object> of recepit is ensem.

349. purpuream animam : tle. his red life-blood. So Homer speaks
of ‘·' blood-red death,⁷' ‘⁴ black-blooded anger‚” etc.

350. fusto: here a “ deed of stealth,’' ·· dark enterprise : ’⁵ furto is
dat. governed by instat.

352. deficere extremum: the adj. is proleptic‚ ’ί burning low.’‘ Cp.
v. 305, n.

354. ferri: passive infinitive offero, which is regularly used in
the passive to express hurried motion—*⁶ that he was rushing on.’
The ablatives are those of the instrument. caede atque cupidine:
hendiadys. Cp. v. 26, η.

356. satis: here used as a noun in nominative case, upon which
poenarum depends as a partitive genitive.

357. virum: cp. V. 6, ns.

358. crateras : cp. v. 265, n. So the Greek form tapeta-3 (τάπητας),
though in v. 325 occurs the regular Latin ablative.

359. The accusatives depend on rapit in V. 3643 but as the long
parenthesis (vv, 360-363) intervenes Ῐῑαεσ is added, appositive, to
resume the thread of the narrative. Aurea bullis einqula = einyula
aure-58 bullis. ·

361. mittit: cp. dat, V. 266, sn. It is certainly historic present
here, as the tense of cimel-et shows (S. G. ξ 423, Oba). iungeret:
sc. Βενηιι-Ζτιηι-ί* as Caedicus, himself far away, was forming ties of
friendship with Remulus; '⁷ lit„ was joining R. (to himself) by
friendship.

362. habere: the infinitive is here used in a quasi-final sense
(ut habeat), inadmissible in prose. It corresponds to the Greek
epexegetic infinitive‚ and to the predicative dat„ the original case
and meaning of the infinitive. The pres sent passageis, perhaps an
instance of the old use: “He gave it to his grands on for possessing3
cp. the exactly parallel sentence, (ῖαΐ paeto librum p1·a‹mz·0,‘·he
gives the boy a book for a presentff’ Cp. S. G. ξ 297, and v. 315, η.
011 the other hand it may be a Graecism.

366. tuta: cp. v. 31, n.

368. campis : locative ablative. On legio, see 174, n.

371. muro: subeo rarely takes a dative, but cp. v. 570, portae
castris. Cp. S. G. ξ 291.

372. flectentis: “turning aside ou the left pathwayj’ asse. “ along
a path to their left.⁷'

373. sublustri: ablativa with umbra. Adjectives which have a
nom. neuter in -e always take the -ἰ ablative for the sake of distinction.

374. adversa: predicative adjective.
