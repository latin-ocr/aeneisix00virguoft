46 AENEID 1x.

671. coelo : either locative‚ ‘³ in the sky‚'' or ablative of separation,
“down from the skies.’'

672. creti : this participle is constructed like natus, qenitus, editus,-
see S. G. ξ 310. This ablative of origin is usually found with the
preposition only when remote descent is spoken of.

674. abietibus : a choriambus (see v. 569) by synizesis of the first
i, which is pronounced as j (y).

675. recludunt: v. 423, n.

676. ultro: = sponte sua, as in V. 729, moenibus: may be ex-
plained as (i) dative, by the usage commented on in v. 5273 or
(ii) ablative (of instrument)—“ welcome with their walls.'’ Op. solio
invitare ; urbe cweipere.

678. capita: S. G. ξ 251.

681. caelo: “to heaven‚’' “for heaven to receive,'' v. 527, n. Cp.
caelo capita alta ferenti&

685. animi: see note on v. 246. Mavortius ε from Mavors, identical
with Mars, and so “ warlike.''

686. agminibus totis: prose would require cum, but the distinction
between the ablative of accompaniment and instrument is very
slight, and the latter is merely a development of the former. So in
Caesar and Livy the preposition is very commonly omitted in military
phraseology3 e.g. Scipio prqfectus in Siciliam est triqinta navibus
Zonyis (Livy XXVIII. 46); pedibu-s· praeliantur (Caesar) ; aqmz‘ne
incidentes (Livy).

692. hostem fervere: the construction is 300115. and infin„ ex-
pressing the purport of the message. Notice the 3rd conjugation form
of fere-ereinstead of the usual fervere. So Vergil uses fellqe7·c³ and
sto-idere. Patentis is predicative, praebeo being used like do, v. 323, n.

697. Thebana: “of Thebe,'' a small Mysian coast town, south of
Mount Ida. Notlcum is here used as a noun with dependent genitive
on the analogy of filius. alti: “great'' rather than “talk’' cp.
Altus Apollo.

699. aera: V. 24, n.

700. volneris: genitive dependent on specu-5⁴, “the cavern of the
black wound.''

702. Erymanta: accusative of Erymas. The greater number of
Greek nominatives in -as, in Vergil, form 300115. in -n 3 e.g. Bitian
(v. 703).

704. dedisset: protasis suppressed, ‘⁴ if he (Turnus) had tried.’'
laculo is ablative in both instances.

705. magnum : cp. v, 631, n. The phalarica was a heavy pike with
an immense iron head and a shaft of wood wrapped in burning tow.
It, and its effects‚ are described in Livy XXI. 8.

706. modo: the noun. The adverb modo has both syllables short.
taurea terga : the bulls’ hides (lit. backs) formed the shield.

707. squama . . . auro: “double plates of gold‚'’ by hendiadyS.

709. clipeum ; the word is elsewhere masculine. Variation in
gender is not uncommon. Caesar, eff„ uses dorsus for dorsum, and
so we have Zuoe and Zao masculine, and χαίτας forfatum.
