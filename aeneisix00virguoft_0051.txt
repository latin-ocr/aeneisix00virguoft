nores. 27

Fuerit (fut. perf.) is used in the protasis because any commands
naturally refer ‘to what is still to be donc, i.e. to future time.
tutos : with αμψοτ-ι’.

44. conferre manum: “to join hands (in battle)‚‘' im. to fight.
Mmstrat here takes accus. and infin, being equivalent to iubet.

45. obiciunt: modern editors write all compounds of ‘incia with
one ’ἱ in present-stem forms, Le. where otherwise iz· would occur.
The scansion, however, remains as if j were printed, and hence the
quantity of the 0 in abiciant. So reicit, conicit (v. 411), etc. Cp.
abietibus, v. 674.

46. expectant: this verb means to “look out forss’ and so to
“ await.” The English ‘⁶ expect '³ bears most commonly some different
meaning.

47 -50. Τ116 word et in V. 48 crcates a difficulty which may be solved
·in two ways: (i) It may be taken as coupling comitatus with im-
provisu-5, in which case ade-st is the main verb——“ Turnus, when hc
had . . . drew near the town accompanied by . . . and unexpected.”
(ii) The words ‘nmenlis . . . rubra may be taken as a parenthesis
and bracketed, and then we must read a comma after rubr-a. In this
case the main verb is ait (v. 52), and aclext depends, like praecem-erat,
on ut—“ when he had . . . and was come near all unexpectedly*
(his horse was Thracian, etc.)-he cried . . .·“’

48. lectis: the ablative is one of the instrument, on the analogy
of ww comitatus Achate. This is very unusual, as a person is
generally regarded as an afferet, not an vlus-Vs‘rrmnmet, and is expres-sed
by ab and the abl. The example quoted shows that it is not a
dative of the agent (S. G. ξ 293). Equitum is partitive genitive.

50. erista rubra : ablative of quality, like maculis albis. It is well
to remember, in translating, that the emphatic position in a hexa-
meter line is at one-or other end of the verse. Here all the adjs. ot*
colour are emphasized, and Turnus mounted is pictured as brilliant-
in white, gold, and scarlet.

51. The verb is omitted as in the English, “ Is there any who will
first with me against the foe 2 ”

53. principium pugnae : “ the fight's commencement.” Principium
is accusative, and the words are appositive to the whole of the
previous sentence. Cp. x. 310, turma-s· incasit ayrestes Aeneas, omen
puqnae.

55. inertia: predicative; sc. αρε-τι). In the next lines the subject
of the three infinitives is viros. Teucrum : see on v. 6.

58. lustrat: the verb means to “trax-erse? whether actually, in
thought, or with the eye. Originally it signified to ‘· purity a thing
by walking about it and pei-forming religious ceremonies,’' whence
came the later meaning.

60. caulas: “holes,” e.g. caulae c·0rpo7·1'-s·:porcs. Here it means
the “ gates ’⁷ of the sold, rather than ‘⁴ pens.”

61. super ε merely = at. So Tennyson : ·'‘ Vstme the middle of the
night Waking she heard the night-towl crow.’⁷

64. rabies: “savage longing,'⁷ whence its construction with
