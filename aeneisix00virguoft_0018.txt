eighteen books 01 Annales in hexameters, a versified history

but Vergil borrowed many expressions and thoughts from
him. There was no other great epic writer until Vergil’s
time, but meanwhile poets were improving the hexameter
and growing familiar with it by long use. Lucilius used
it for Satires, and Lucretius for the didactie poetry 01

expeoting new thoughts or subjects. Still the subject of
the Aeneid is in the main original, for it is an Italian epic,
