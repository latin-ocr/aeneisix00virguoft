part justified by older or colloquial use 3 ay. simple ablative
of place without prepositions 3 simple accusative of destina-
tion ; dative of the goal of motion 3 accusative after
intransitive and passive verbs 3 constant use of the personal
dative (z genitive), and of the adjective as substantive.
Many idioms are said to be imitations from the Greek, but
are quite as probably independent outgrowths of Latin
speech. Such is the use of the genitive of respect with
adjectives, and of the infinitive dependent upon adjectives,
and even upon nounS, and the extens-ion of that mood to
replace subjunctive clauses with many verbs of persuading,
praying, striving, etc. Archaisms are numerous3 some-
times they appear in spelling, sometimes in old obsolete
words, or in the use of metres and metrica] quantities found
in the language of Ennius, but already lost in Vergil's own
time. The various figures of speech, hendiadys, hypallage,
metonymy, and many others are freely used, similes are
constantly occurring, and the sound and rhythm are made
to express the sense by the aid of alliteration, broken lines,
and other iecognised artifices. Vei gil' is at once one of the
most simple and most aitificial of poets, he works up the
most simple words into the most altificial phiases3 and it
is said indeed that upon the elaboration of some of his
writings he spent a. day ,on every line.

Hexameter, in which each verse consists of six seet
(ἔξ, μέτρον), and each foot is a dactyl (ἶ ψ ψ> 01· its
equivalent, a spondee (- -).

(A spondee is said to be the equivalent of a chetyl
because one long syllable takes to pronounce an equal time
with two short ones. Therefore - ψ υ and - - are
ρ equal.)

To this the last (sixth) foot is an except-ion, admitting
only of two syllables, of 'which the last may be common (g ).
Three syllables never occur in this foot: they apparently,
but only apparently, occur when the final syllable disappears
by elision before the initia] vowel of the following line,
