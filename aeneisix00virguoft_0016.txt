xii INTRODUCTION.

Despairing of success with so few followers, Aeneas goes
to seek assistance from Euander the Arcadian, who had
made his way to the Palatine Hill and had there built a
city. The opportunity is taken to describe the old land-
marks of Rome and to interweave many legends of the
ancient times, notably that of Hercules and Cacus.
Euander greets the wanderer warmly, and sends his only
son Pallas to support him 3 and Venus brings to the hero
a suit of armour wrought for him by Vulcan‚ of which the
shield portrays all the mighty wars of Rome down to the
battle of Actium <Book VIR).

Meanwhile, Aeneas being still absent and secking further
allies amongst the Etrurians, the Rutulians beset the
Trojan camp by the Tiber. Nisus and Euryalus, two of
the Trojans, undertake to break through the enemy's lines
and carry to Aeneas warm'ng of his people's dangers.
They enter the Latin camp, slaying and pillaging in the
darkness 3 then leave at dawn‚ are intercepted by a body
of cavalry and separated. Euryalus is captured, and
Nisus, endeavouring in vain to save his comrade’s life, is
slain. Again the Rutulians attack, and Turnus actually
forces his way into the camp, from which he is only driven
with great effort by Mnestheus (Book IX).

In Book X. Jupiter in couneil bids the goddesses and gods
lay aside their partialities and suffer fate to take its course.
Aeneas returns from his expedition and falls upon the
besiegers. Turnus slays Pallas, Aeneas comes to avenge
him, but finds that J uno has withdrawn his foe by a ruse.
He contents himself with attacking the “godless’' Mezentius,
who took service with the Latins when exiled for his
cruelties from his kingdom of Caere, and to chastise whom
the Etruscans have sent ample forces to the assistance of
the Trojans. His son Lausus comcs to his aid and the
father escapes wounded, then, learning that his son is
slain, rushes back to the fight and is slain by Aeneas

In Book XI. comes the story of tho buria] of the fallen
warriors, and of an attempt at conciliation which is
frustrated by Turnus' violence. Aeneas prepares to attack
Laurentum, Latinus' city, and there follows a cavalry
battle in which Camilla, queen of the Volsci, does great
