A vowel at the end of a word is elided before a vowel at
the beginning of the next word. &Vhen this does not take

hexameter verse, where it is of constant occurrence. See

(i.e. last syllable but one) is long 3 in which case it falls on
that.'' There is no accent on the last syllable. Thus
Interea, intima& intrcire. This law applies to all classical
Latin with the one exception—that words which 11310
dropped a final syllable, eg. audin, moscin (=au.df.s›ne‚
