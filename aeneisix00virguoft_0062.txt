377. The infinitives in this and the following line are historic, and

are preferred here to mark the rapidity of the various actions. Such
an infin. merely states the fact of an occurrence without regard to

390. regione : “in what direction 2 '⁹ This is one of the words
which are regularly used in the simple locative ablative. See V. 3, n.

394. sequentum: metrical reasons make the more usual genitive

to strike. Ocius does duty for both positive and comparative degrees.
