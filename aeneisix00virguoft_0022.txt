ξ 9. Iris, messenger of J uno, appears to Turnus and bids
him take advantage of Aeneas' absence to attack the

A Trojans. He obeys, marshals his men, and
rgument of

Book IX· dares the Trojans to give battle. They refuse ’

to leave their defenceS, and he endeavours to fire
the towers and their ships (1—76). Cybele, when the pines
were cut wherewith to build these vessels, had entreated

Jupiter to make them invulnerable. He had consented to ν

change them to sea nymphs when danger threatened them.
So now there comes a voice from heaven, the vessels break
from their moorings, and turn to Nereids (77—122).
Turnus, baulked, delivers a long and insulting speech, and

fight. The Trojans remain watchful (123—175). Night.
Nisus tells Euryalus of his wish to bear to Aeneas the
news of their peril. The two decide to go together. They

The fame of their love shall never die. The Rutulians set
their heads upon spears and stand to arms. The confljct
is postponed awhile by the grief and cries of Euryalus'
mother, who has learnt her son’s fate and begs the foe to
slay her too She is carried off the field by the Trojans
(446-502>. The Rutulians again attack the defences.
