INTRODUCTION. xix

Turnus, taunts bhe besieged, and is slain by an arrow from
Iulus’ bow. Apollo sees and applauds the deed3 but, in
the form of Butes, forbids the boy to mix further in the
fray, then vanishes (503—671). Pandarus and Bitias
open and keep the gate of the qamp. The latter is slain
by Turnus, and Pandarus, forced to retreat, shuts the gabe
again with Turnus inside. The latter spreads death abou‘c
him until Mnestheus rallies the Trojans and drives him out
again, forcing him to leap into the Tiber‚ which carries
him down to his comrades <GH—818).
