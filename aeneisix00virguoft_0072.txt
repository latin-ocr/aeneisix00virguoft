48 AENEID ix.

767. Noemona: like Aqamemnona, S. G. ξ 40.

770. occupat: ‘·' surprises.’' The word only occasionally means
“to occupy.” Usually it signifies “ to do something before another,’'
and so “to forestall,'’ ‘³ be the first to ;'' and often as here with a
noun-accusative, to ‘⁶ catch one before he is prepared.''

773. ungere : the use of an infinitive depending upon adjectives is
a Graecism occasionally admitted by Vergil and very common in
Horace. Prose would require a gerundive construction with acl or
in, or a subjunctive clause with qui. Cp. indocili-s· pati, audam
perpeti.

776. cordi ε cp. v. 615, 11.

782. muros . . . moenia: cp. vv, 39, 43‚196. illumi-——the defences
of the camp : moenia = the camp itself as a means of defence.

785. ediderit: “ Is he to have caused !'' The future perfect is
used in indignant remonstrances to draw attention to the results of
the completed action. Cp. occiderit Pl‘e'amus—“ Shall Priam die,
and shall we suffer it ! ” So miserit. Oreo : cp. v. 527, η.

786. non: = nonne. Cp. v. 598.

789. excedere : this and the following infins. are historical.

791. hoc: cp. V. 416.

793. cum: either preposition or conjunctim, probably the latter.

7 94. acerba tuens: adverbia] accusative. Cp. v, 125, n.

796. potis: an old adj. form, the neuter being pote. The old
conjugation was pot’s snm (pot’s est or) pote est, which became
J103-521711,])0test ,· and the 2nd sing. was formed after the analogy of
the 3rd sing, potes. Fotis, the adjective, is not found in the oblique
caseS, whence come potior, potas-samar.

799. quin: v, 465‚n. Etiam is usually added, as here. Notice
the mixture of tenses in this and the next line. The pluperfect is
used like d·e’.1·e›·at,v.104, n. Vertz’t is perfect.

803. sufficere: here transitive, but intransitive in V. 810. Either
usage is common.

804. Both Jupiter and J uno were the childien of Saturn (Cronos).

805. cedat: the protasis 15 virtually contained in the words haud
mollia—‘ ‘commands which should be stern indeed did not T. retire.”
’1115 usage is very common. The use of the graphic present for the

- more usual imperfect is rare, but cf. ηὶ faciat, maria ac· terras . . .

serant.
806. tantum: 'so muchss’ ἰ ..e as much as the occasion required.
815. omnibus armis: sec note on v. 686. In the next line the
preposition is used, and the eddy spoken of as something accom-
panying, whereas the omission of ⁴cum and the treatment of the
ablative as instrumenta] would have been much more natural. prae-
ceps : cp. v. 420,n.
