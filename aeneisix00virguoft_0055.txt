NoTEs. 31

*non excedamus, “they lay down boundaries which we are not to
cross ;’' but Vergil extends it to the imperfect and pluperfect tenses,
e.g. eade-m me ad fata rocas-sex ,· αΐ tn dietis, Albane, manet-ew or
(ii) potential subjunctive (S. G. ξ 429), analogous to the colloquial
English “you might do it,'’ etc.‚ where the emphasis is on the word
“might.” For penitus, see v. 1, n.

141. modii : cp. note on v. 706: modo non modify omne.

142. medii : ‘⁵ between them and me.” Valla· is objective,fo.58armn
subjective genitive—‘⁶ the resistance caused by their foss.'’ leti
discrimina : “ the space separating them from death.'’ Leti is the Greek
genitive of separation, analogous to that mentioned in S. G. ξ 284.

146. vos . . . quis: the interrogative is loosely appositive to the
personal pronoun‚ which would, in strict grammar, have introduced
not a question but a command, a stlta rate. Apparat is used vividly,
as in English, for the future. Cf. quid ayo? ‘⁴ What am I on the
point of doing ? ”

148. The armour of Aeneas was wrought for him by Vulcan.

149. opus: is commonly constructed with the ablative (instru-
mental) of the thing needed; but it admits also ot the nominative
(to which it is predicative), and of the genitive, which in many points
is interchangeable with the ablative. S. G. ξ 316. addant: jussive
subjunctive.

151. Palladii z the Palladium, upon which depended the existence
of Troy, was stolen by Diomedes and Ulysses. For the allusion in
the next line, see Index, ὅτε. Troia.

153. certum est: “it is my resolve.’' esp-mundare admits of two
constructions : (1) circumdo muris (dat.) {quem ,· (2) circumdo muros
iqui (abl.)

154. faxo (cf. awo, cap-5³0, (ll-1²0) :was originally a subjunctive of
sigmatic aorist, like Greek ἄξω. δείξω, etc. Similarly erm (es-0) was
originally the subjunctive of suna Later the subjunctive significa-
tion was merged into the future in these words. In sim, j'am'm,
diatim, and ausi-m (audeo) is preserved the optative aorist form3
sim = 3-ie-m; cf. εἴην = ἑ(σ)-ἱη-ν.

155. ferant : indirect jussive subjunctive, regularly joined without
‘ut to facio, volo, euro, and many verbs of asking. This represents
the original form: (lie, eat, = speak, let him go (Parataoeis). The
insertion of ‘ut makes the second clause syntactically subordinate,
die ut eat, speak in order that he may go (Hypataoeis). The only
difference between the two expressions is syntactical: the meaning
is the same—tell him to g0. Danaa· and Pelasqi are both names ot‘
the Greeks. So, too, Achivi, Aryole'ez'. Turnus says that the Rutuli
will bring ruin upon the Trojans more speedily than did the Greeks.
The order is faxo ferant Ila-ud siha· rem esse cnm Danais et pube Pela-<yth

156. adeo: frequently used by Vergil to emphasise persona] pro-
nouns‚ numerals, or adverbs like iam, nune, etc. In prose it is
simply used as the correlative of ut.

157. quod superest: either (i) simply “as to what remains‚’' “for
the rest ;” where qnod is an accus. of limitation3 or (ii) sc. (lieet
